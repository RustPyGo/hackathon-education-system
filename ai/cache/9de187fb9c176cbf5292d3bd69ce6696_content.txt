Biology Exam - Paper 6 Revision Notes  
Enzyme activity lab : 
2H 2O2 (l) →  2H 2O (l) + O 2 (g) 
This reaction can be catalysed by an enzyme (catalase) or by a non -biological catalyst (Manganese IV oxide)  
1. Put 3cm2 of hydrogen peroxide in a test tube.  
2. Add fresh potato strips and shake gently.  
3. Keep your  thumb on top of the test tube, or use a stopper, to retain the gas.  
4. Do the “glowing splint” test → the splint relights  
Positive control: repeat the original experiment using manganese IV oxide → bubbles of oxygen form  
 Conclusion: the reaction happens because of a catalyst  
1st negative control: repeat the original experiment using boiled  potato strips → nothing happens  
 Conclusion: enzymes denature when they are at high temperatures  
2nd negative control: repeat the original experiment using water instead of hydrogen peroxide → nothing happens  
 Conclusion: hydrogen peroxide is the substrate  
3rd negative control: repeat in a cold environment, the effervescence should be slower  
 Conclusion: enzymes don’t work as well in the cold  
 
Chemical tests : 
-starch : add a few drops of iodine solution , a positive result (i.e. starch is present) is a deep blue -black  colour, a 
negative result is orange.  
-reducing sugars  (e.g. glucose): Benedict’s reagent , then the mixture is heated for 2 to 3 minutes. Positive result is 
an orange/brick -red colour, negative result is blue (the colour of the Benedict’s reagent).  
-proteins : add a few drops of Biuret reagent , a positive result is a mauve/purple  colour.  
-fats: the emulsion test : ethanol is added to the mixture, this is poured into a test tube with an equal number of 
distilled water, a positive result a milky -white emulsion forms.  
 
Investigating the factors necessary  for photosynthesis : 
Chlorophyll  – with a variegated leaf...  
1) Leaf is boiled in water for 2 minutes: to break down cell walls, denature the enzymes and allow for easier 
penetration by ethanol.  
2) Warmed in ethanol until leaf is colorless: to extract the chlorophyll, which would mask observation (you need 
to see a color change), chlorophyll is soluble in ethanol but not water.  
3) Dipped in water briefly: to soften leaf  
4) Leaf is placed on a white tile and iodine is added: if starch is present the color will be blue -black, if it is absent 
it will be orange -brown, this is shown against the white tile.  
 
Light : de-starch the plant by placing it in a dark cupboard or box for 48 hours, so that there is no starch in the leaves. 
Then you can:  
A) Clip a black paper onto both sides of the leaf to make a strip  
B) Make an air -tight bag around a leaf with soda lime (absorbs CO 2) in it.  
C) Make an air -tight bag around a leaf with hydrogencarbonate solution (provides CO 2) in it.  
Then remove leaf and:  
1. Leaf is boiled in water for 2 minutes: to break down cell walls, denature the enzymes and allow for easier 
penetration by ethanol.

Carbon dioxide:  
Required materials  
• 2 Potted plants  
• 2 Bell -jars 
• A Candle  
• Dish containing Caustic soda  
• Petroleum jelly  
• Glass sheets  
• Iodine solution to test leaves for starch  
Estimated Experiment Time  
Approximately 10 minutes to set up the apparatus and 8 -12 hours to carry out the observations  
Step -By-Step Procedure  
• 1. Take two young potted plants.  
• 2. Apply petroleum jelly on two glass sheets.  
• 3. Place the potted plants on these glass sheets.  
• 4. On one glass sheet, along with the potted plant place a burning candle.  
• 5. In the other, place a dish containing caustic soda.  
• 6. Cover them with the bell jars.  
• 7. Leave undisturbed for a few hours and test the leaves from each pot for the presence of starch.  
Note  
• Potted plants must ideally have been kept in the dark to make the leaves starch -free before including them in 
this experiment.  
• The petroleum jelly makes the bell jars airtight.  
 
Investigating what happens when varying  the factors affecting 
photosynthesis : 
 
NOTE: this diagram is from an IGCSE paper 6 (and the “gas” is oxygen and the pondweed is in water)  
Light intensity : (NOTE: I copied this from “model answer”) First a lamp is placed as close as possible to the 
apparatus, then the experiment is repeated several times, each times with the lamp further away from the apparatus. 
Heat from the bulb is prevented from affecting the result by placing a clear glass sheet between the lamp and the

==================================================
apparatus, and the pond weed used is left for several minutes in each new light intensity to allow it to adjust to new 
conditions before rate is measured.  
Carbon dioxide : vary the amount of hydrogen carbonate in the solution, this supplies the plant with carbon 
dioxide for photosynthesis (light intensity and temperature are controlled variables)  
 
Temperature : set up the apparatus  in several different -temperature environments  
The effect of temperature on plant growth  
 
 
 
Investigating transpiration rate : the potometer (page 91)  
 
1. Leafy shoot must be cut, the apparatus filled and the shoot fixed to the potometer, all under water to prevent air 
locks in system. Capillary tube must be horizontal otherwise the bubble will move because of its lower density.  
2. Allow plant to equilibrate (5min) before introducing air bubble. Measure rate of bubble movement at least 3 times, 
and use reservoir to return bubble to zero each time. Record air temperature and find mean of readings.  
3. Find out leaf area to calculate rate of water uptake per unit of leaves.  
Variables: temperature, air humidity, light intensity and wind (using a fan vs. no fan, I guess).  
 
Investigation: how plants respond to gravity (geotropism)  
1) Freshly germinate broad bean seedlings inside a glass jar, the seed is held by a roll of moist clotting paper.  
2) Seedlings are allowed to grow for a further five days, with the jars placed a) the right way up b) upside down and c) 
on its side.  
In each case the roots will turn to go downwards, and the shoot turns to grow upwards, (diagram page 162).  
 
Investigating the light sensitive region (phototropism)  
1) There are three groups of coleoptiles (oat shoots). A) Has its tips removed, B) tips are covered and C) are untreated.  
2) The coleoptiles are measured, and lengths recorded.  
3)They are put in light proof boxes with one gap which only allow light to enter laterally (from the side).  
4) They are measured 2 -3 days later, and new lengths are recorded.  
Untreated coleoptiles will grow the most.  
Other experiments:  
Mark rings around the shoot, all the same length away from each other. After growth towards the sunlight, the spaces 
will increase in different areas showing where growth has taken place.  
(All of these experiments on phototropism are on pages 160 -161 with diagrams).  
 
Osmosis, hypertonic, hypotonic and isotonic solutions  & determining the 
concentration inside a cell  
Remember:  
In an isotonic solution : concentration of solute outside cell = concentration inside cell → no change in size  
In a hypertonic solution : concentration of solute outside cell > concentration inside cell → cell shrinks  
In a hypotonic solution : concentration of solute outside cell < concentration inside cell → cell swells

==================================================
 
Potato strips are placed in solutions of different concentrations (you have to know the concentrations). They are 
measured in mass before and after being in the solutions. The solution in which the potato strip does not change in 
mass is the isotonic solution, but it is unlikely that the solution will be exactly the right concentration, so you have to p lot 
a graph and find what the concentration is. Concentration on the x -axis and mass change in the y -axis (note: the line 
will go above and below the x -axis since some of the potato strips will shrink). Where the line intersects the x -axis, 
there is no mass change so that is the concentration inside the potato.  
 
Demonstrating osmosis : 
This is like the potato strip experiment but it simply demonstrates that osmosis occurs, it does not determine the 
concentration of the cells
